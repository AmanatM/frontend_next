# How to Center a Div in CSS

Centering a div is a common task in web development, but it can be achieved in several ways depending on your needs and the specific layout you’re working with. In this post, we’ll explore different methods to center a div both horizontally and vertically.

## Using Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful layout tool that makes centering elements straightforward.

  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}`}
/>

The `margin: auto` method is a straightforward way to center a block-level element horizontally.

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```
