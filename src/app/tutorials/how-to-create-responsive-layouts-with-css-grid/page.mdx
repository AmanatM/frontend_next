# How To Create Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid

CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool for creating responsive and flexible web layouts. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use CSS Grid to design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Basic Grid Setup

To get started with CSS Grid, you need a grid container. Inside the grid container, you'll place your grid items. Here's a basic example:

<PairedItemsPerspectiveCard childrenStyles="h-10 w-10 flex-1" containerStyles="flex" />

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}

.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="item">Item 5</div>
  <div class="item">Item 6</div>
</div>
```

In this example, .container is the grid container with three equal-width columns, and .item represents the grid items.

## Creating a Responsive Layout

To make your layout responsive, you can use media queries to adjust the grid configuration based on the screen size. Here’s an example:

<ComponentGroup>

</ComponentGroup>

With these media queries, the grid layout adjusts to two columns on screens smaller than 800px and to a single column on screens smaller than 500px.

## Using Grid Areas

CSS Grid allows you to define grid areas for more complex layouts. Here’s an example of a layout with different sections:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar content"
    "footer footer";
  gap: 10px;
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
  background-color: lightcoral;
  padding: 20px;
}

.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  padding: 20px;
}

.content {
  grid-area: content;
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
}

.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="header">Header</div>
  <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
  <div class="content">Content</div>
  <div class="footer">Footer</div>
</div>
```

This layout defines specific areas for the header, sidebar, content, and footer, making it easy to create structured and organized layouts.
