# Understanding CSS Color Formats

CSS has a whole slew of different color formats: hex codes, rgb(), hsl(), lch(), and more.

Which one should we use? It might seem like an inconsequential decision, but there are some pretty important differences between them. And, honestly, I think most of us are prioritizing the wrong things. ðŸ˜…

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll take you on a tour of the different options. Weâ€™ll see how they work, how we can decipher them, and how we can use them to our advantage. Later, Iâ€™ll show you how modern CSS lets us make on-the-fly adjustments if we pick the right color format.

## Named Colors

So, this isnâ€™t really a color format, but itâ€™s a good place to start!

HTML comes with 140 named colors. These are special keyword values like dodgerblue, hotpink, and tomato:

<SimpleStaticCodeEditor
  html={`<p>Hello world</p>`}
  css={`
    p {
      color: tomato;
    }
  `}
/>
