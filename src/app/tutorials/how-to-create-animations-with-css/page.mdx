# How To Create Animations with CSS

CSS animations allow you to add dynamic effects to your web pages. You can create animations using keyframes and the animation property.

## Keyframes

Keyframes define the stages of an animation. Hereâ€™s an example:

```css
@keyframes slidein {
  from {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
}
```

## Using the Animation Property

The animation property applies the animation to an element.

```css
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  animation: slidein 2s ease-in-out;
}
```

## Multiple Animations

You can also apply multiple animations to an element by separating them with commas.

```css
@keyframes fadein {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.box {
  animation: slidein 2s ease-in-out, fadein 2s ease-in-out;
}
```

## Animation Shorthand

The animation property is a shorthand for several sub-properties: animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, and animation-play-state.

```css
.box {
  animation: slidein 2s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate both;
}
```
